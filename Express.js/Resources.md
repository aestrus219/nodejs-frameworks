#### Example projects

There are many example projects available that demonstrate how to use Express.js for different types of applications.

Here's an example of an Express.js project that implements a simple chat application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const http = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(http);

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('a user connected');
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    console.log('message: ' + msg);
    io.emit('chat message', msg);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('user disconnected');
  });
});

http.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
```

This code defines an Express.js app that serves static files from a "public" folder and defines a route for the main page ("/") that sends an HTML file. The app also uses the Socket.IO library to implement real-time communication between clients.

When a user connects to the app, the app logs a message to the console and sets up event listeners for sending and receiving chat messages. When a user sends a chat message, the app logs the message to the console and emits the message to all connected clients. When a user disconnects, the app logs a message to the console.
