# Other Features

#### Events

AngularJS provides a way to bind events to DOM elements. This allows you to react to user interactions, such as clicks, mouseenters, and keystrokes.

To bind an event, you use the `ng-click`, `ng-mouseenter`, or `ng-keyup` directives. For example, the following code will bind a click event to the `submit` button and call the `submitForm()` function when the button is clicked:

```js
<button ng-click="submitForm()">Submit</button>
```

#### DOM Manipulation

AngularJS provides a way to manipulate the DOM. This allows you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

To manipulate the DOM, you use the `ng-repeat`, `ng-show`, and `ng-hide` directives. For example, the following code will repeat the `item` array in the DOM and hide the `error` element if the `isValid` variable is true:

```js
<div ng-repeat="item in items">
  {{item.name}}
</div>
<div ng-show="isValid">
  <p>The form is valid.</p>
</div>
<div ng-hide="isValid">
  <p>The form is not valid.</p>
</div>
```

#### AJAX

AngularJS provides a way to make AJAX requests. This allows you to fetch data from a server without reloading the entire page.

To make an AJAX request, you use the `$http` service. For example, the following code will make an AJAX request to the `/api/users` endpoint and then display the results in the `users` div:

```js
$http.get('/api/users').then(function(response) {
  $scope.users = response.data;
});
```

#### Internationalization

AngularJS provides a way to internationalize your application. This allows you to support multiple languages and locales.

To internationalize your application, you use the `ng-translate` directive. For example, the following code will translate the `Hello, world!` string to the user's preferred language:

```js
<p ng-translate="hello">Hello, world!</p>
```

#### Unit Testing

AngularJS provides a way to unit test your application. This allows you to ensure that your code is working correctly before you deploy it to production.

To unit test your application, you use the Jasmine testing framework. For example, the following code will create a unit test for the `submitForm()` function:

```js
describe('submitForm', function() {
  it('should submit the form', function() {
    // Arrange
    var scope = $scope.$new();
    var form = angular.element('<form ng-submit="submitForm()">');

    // Act
    form.submit();

    // Assert
    expect(scope.formSubmitted).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

#### End-to-End Testing

AngularJS provides a way to end-to-end test your application. This allows you to test your application from the user's perspective.

To end-to-end test your application, you use the Protractor testing framework. For example, the following code will create an end-to-end test for the `submitForm()` function:

```js
describe('submitForm', function() {
  it('should submit the form', function() {
    // Arrange
    browser.get('http://localhost:8080');
    var form = element(by.css('form'));

    // Act
    form.submit();

    // Assert
    expect(element(by.css('p.success')).isPresent()).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
