### Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications. It provides a centralized store for managing the state of your application, making it easier to manage and share data between components.

#### Installation

To install Vuex you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
npm install vuex
```

or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add vuex
```

#### Basic usage

To use Vuex in your Vue.js application, you need to create a store instance and define your state:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    }
  }
});

const app = new Vue({
  store
}).$mount('#app');
```

This code creates a new store instance with a `count` state property and an `increment` mutation.

To access the store's state in your components, you can use the `$store` object:

```javascript
export default {
  computed: {
    count() {
      return this.$store.state.count;
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.$store.commit('increment');
    }
  }
}
```

This code defines a computed property that returns the store's `count` state property and a method that commits the `increment` mutation.

#### Mutations

Mutations are the only way to change the state in a Vuex store. To define a mutation, you can use the `mutations` property:

```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.count--;
    }
  }
});
```

This code defines two mutations: `increment` and `decrement`.

To commit a mutation in your components, you can use the `$store.commit` method:

```javascript
this.$store.commit('increment');
```

This code commits the `increment` mutation.

#### Actions

Actions are used to perform asynchronous operations and commit mutations. To define an action, you can use the `actions` property:

```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    }
  },
  actions: {
    incrementAsync(context) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        context.commit('increment');
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
});
```

This code defines an `incrementAsync` action that commits the `increment` mutation after a delay.

To dispatch an action in your components, you can use the `$store.dispatch` method:

```javascript
this.$store.dispatch('incrementAsync');
```

This code dispatches the `incrementAsync` action.

#### Getters

Getters are used to compute derived state based on the store's state. To define a getter, you can use the `getters` property:

```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    }
  },
  getters: {
    doubleCount(state) {
      return state.count * 2;
    }
  }
});
```

This code defines a `doubleCount` getter that returns the store's `count` state property multiplied by 2.

To access a getter in your components, you can use the `$store.getters` object:

```javascript
export default {
  computed: {
    doubleCount() {
      return this.$store.getters.doubleCount;
    }
  }
}
```

This code defines a computed property that returns the `doubleCount` getter.
